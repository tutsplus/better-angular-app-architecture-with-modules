## Instructor: [Dan Wellman][instructor url]


When you're just starting out with Angular, you'll probably write your app as a single module. This works fine for small apps, but for more complex, production apps the single-module approach will quickly get out of control, leading to hard-to maintain code.

In this course you'll learn all about moving from a small single-module Angular app to a larger, more complex multi-module architecture. Along the way, you'll see a practical example of how to can break an app down into discrete sections in order to minimise and organise the complexity that growth of the codebase brings.

## Source Files Description:

The repo for this course contains the starter application in the initial state. There is also a branch of the repo called `completed_app` which contains the complete application as it will appear at the end of the course.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.2.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
